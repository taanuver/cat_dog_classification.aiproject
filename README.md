Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning based image classification model that classifies images into two categories: Cat and Dog. 

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a labeled dataset containing images of cats and dogs.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model building using CNN
- Batch Normalization and Dropout to reduce overfitting
- Training and validation accuracy analysis
- Loss and accuracy visualization using Matplotlib

Results:
The model achieved good training accuracy but showed signs of overfitting on validation data. Regularization techniques were applied to improve generalization.

Future Scope:
- Implement Transfer Learning (MobileNet/VGG16)
- Improve validation accuracy
- Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask
